# Deep Learning Project
Group project for course **DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science** at **KTH** in 2021.
The task of the project is to develop and compare deep learning models for generating Harry Potter-like text.

### RNN
A vanilla RNN network developed from scratch to predict sequences of characters.

### Transformer
A Transformer model developed with PyTorch to predict sequences of words/tokens. The char_transformer is an unfinished attempt at creating a Transformer model for character predictions.

### LSTM
A LSTM model developed with PyTorch to predict sequences of characters.
